Managing the Map Visualization and Data on ArcGIS Online
========================================================

# Update the Map Visualization (Publishing profiles to ArcGIS Online)

The map is updated by publishing data from the Parse.com database to ArcGIS Online Feature service. Publishing fresh data involves the following steps:

1. Opening a terminal
2. Navagating to the directory with the `agol_integration.py` script
3. Setting environment variables to access AGOL and set target feature
4. Running python script
5. Checking output

The `agol_integration.py` script requires username and password and target feature enviornment (development, staging, production) to  be set.
(Service being used by map is defined in the file `html/map/viz/app/js/map/map_config.js`.)

#### Example terminal session of these steps:

```
# navigate to repository
cd /path/projects/odesurvey

# navigate to directory with agol_integration.py script
cd scripts/agol-integration/agol_integration

# set environmental variables
AGOL_USER=myuserame
export AGOL_USER
AGOL_PASS=mypassword
export AGOL_PASS
AGOL_ENV=development
export AGOL_ENV

# Run agol_integration.py
python agol_integration.py

```

*NOTE* If you receive an error starting with "InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail...", correct this issue by installing requests-security module using pip with the shell command: `sudo pip install requests[security]`

#### Example terminal session output from command `python agol_integration.py`
```

# Dev / Staging / Production for Map

### In the viz app source files

In the file `viz-src/src/app/js/map/map_config.js` the first few lines set up where the application gets the data:11
```
  var agsserver = "https://services5.arcgis.com/w1WEecz5ClslKH2Q/ArcGIS/rest/services";
  var runAs = 'develop';
  var mode = {
    'develop': 'ode_organizations_dev',
    'staging': 'ode_organizations_staging',
    'production': 'ode_organizations_dev'
  }
```

To change the service the application pulls from in the source you need to change the line to which mode you’d like: ‘develop’, ‘staging’, ‘production'

```
  var runAs = 'develop’;
```

### In the viz app compiled files

These lines are compiled into the file `html/map/viz/app/js/map/map_config.js` to be displayed as:
```
  var e="https://services5.arcgis.com/w1WEecz5ClslKH2Q/ArcGIS/rest/services",a="develop",t={develop:"ode_organizations_dev",staging:"ode_organizations_staging",production:"ode_organizations_dev"},
```

To change the service the application pulls from in the compiled app change the value to which mode you’d like: ‘develop’, ‘staging’, ‘production'

```
  a="develop"
```

AGOL Python Integration:
To change to service to be updated when running the script:

In the file scripts/agol-integration/agol-integration/settings.py there are three class, one for each of the environments:

```
class DevelopmentSettings(BaseSettings):
    def __init__(self):
        BaseSettings.__init__(self)
        self.agol_feature_service_url = 'https://services5.arcgis.com/w1WEecz5ClslKH2Q/arcgis/rest/services/ode_organizations_dev/FeatureServer/0'

class StagingSettings(BaseSettings):
    def __init__(self):
        BaseSettings.__init__(self)
        self.agol_feature_service_url = 'https://services5.arcgis.com/w1WEecz5ClslKH2Q/arcgis/rest/services/ode_organizations_staging/FeatureServer/0'

class ProductionSettings(BaseSettings):
    def __init__(self):
        BaseSettings.__init__(self)
        self.agol_feature_service_url = 'https://services5.arcgis.com/w1WEecz5ClslKH2Q/arcgis/rest/services/ode_organizations_production/FeatureServer/0'
```

# Updating ArcGIS Online Schema

When updating ArcGIS Online Schema be sure to do the following:

1. Make sure the Schema is available to everyone
2. Update the service definition from default 1000 records to greater than or equal to the number of being uploaded (e.g., 12000 is a good number). To update the service use the url that includes `ArcGIS/rest/admin` as in: `http://services.arcgis.com/[appid]/arcgis/rest/admin/services/ode_organizations_schema_07302015/FeatureServer/0/updateDefinition`
