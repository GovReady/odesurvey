=====

Goal: Figure out a simple method to update the parse record using checklist code as example.
Benefit: Have a partially working survey

docs
- slim
- x-editable
- checklist code (github)
- bootstrap

Plan: 
√remove orgname common
√create parse database
√create config file
√give others access to parse? Audrey and Gustavo
√study q and checklist code for routine to push records
√study x-editable
xopen up x-editable console on page
create unit test for writing record
√try to create record on load
√- open up q 
try to update record

Predict:
3 hours
learn: 
- Opportunity to refactor checklist code
- I should put in a test 
- I don't have much error handling
- do I use javascript or php backend to write info?

risks
- javascript vs. php > whatever works
- won't work > did it before, give up after 30 mins and use time for something else
- will want to keep going > stop when goal reached

simpler alternative: hire someone
- cant'f find them, need this for other items
- do I have storing data working in 
- I have storing working in other globalnet! in q!
